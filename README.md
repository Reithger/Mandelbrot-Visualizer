# Mandelbrot-Visualizer
 
Small program to examine the image created by mapping the Mandelbrot set in a coordinate plane; let's you zoom in and move around, as well as change the level of definition (how many iterationsyou run each point through to figure out if it's in the Mandelbrot set or not) to let the image load faster while moving around or get more specificity at a particular point.

Just download and run that 'Mandelbrot-Visualizer.jar' file to get it up and running; very rough UI because it was an hour project to put together, if I get a rainy Sunday I might touch it up a bit.
